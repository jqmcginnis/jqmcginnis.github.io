Embedded Systems engineer, turned software engineer, turned deep learning reseacher.

My research is centered on the intersection of medicine, neuroscience, and machine learning, with a specific focus on Multiple Sclerosis (MS) 
and the integrated analysis of the brain and spinal cord. 

I am particularly interested in implicit neural representations and compact latent representations for various downstream tasks. 
These tasks include but are not limited to generative modeling, image reconstruction, and lesion segmentation.
